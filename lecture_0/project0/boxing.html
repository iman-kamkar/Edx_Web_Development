			<span class='name'>Boxing</span> is a combat sport in which two people, usually wearing protective gloves, throw punches at each other for a predetermined set of time in a boxing ring. 
		</p>
		<p id = 'amateur'>
			<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_boxing'>Amateur boxing</a> may be found at the collegiate level, at the Olympic Games and Commonwealth Games, and in many other venues sanctioned by amateur boxing associations. Amateur boxing has a point scoring system that measures the number of clean blows landed rather than physical damage. Bouts consist of three rounds of three minutes in the Olympic and Commonwealth Games, and three rounds of three minutes in a national ABA (Amateur Boxing Association) bout, each with a one-minute interval between rounds.

		<h2>Boxing styles</h2>
		<div id='style'>
			"Style" is often defined as the strategic approach a fighter takes during a bout. No two fighters' styles are alike, as each is determined by that individual's physical and mental attributes. Three main styles exist in boxing:
			<ul>
				<li class='name'> <a href='boxer.html'>Boxer/out-fighter</a> </li>
				<li class='name'> <a href="puncher.html">Boxer-puncher</a> </li>
				<li class='name'> <a href='counter.html'>Counter-puncher</a> </li>
			</ul>
